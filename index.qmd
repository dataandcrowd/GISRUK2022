- A silent minority who needs information about public facilities
- A community with local knowledge but weakness in internet technology
- Voluntary works are to some extent associated with the time spent on computers and social media (Jago et al., 2014; Clary et al., 2020)

## Under-representation and Spatial Bias

- A well-known feature of the data from citizen science projects is the patchy distribution of maps across space and time
- This leaves global citizen science datasets with spatial and temporal gaps and redundancies
- The majority tend to contribute to more familiar areas
- The minority spend less time on volunteered works, tend to contribute to neighbourhood areas

<!--
## Research Gaps
Current literature of citizen science looking at spatial and temporal biases:
Ecological Fallacy
Do not breakdown the records by demographic groups even though certain cohorts have different distributions than their counterparts. These studies only imply gender or age biases as a whole.
Focus either on demographic characteristics or spatial and temporal patterns - the two perspectives are usually not put into relation with each other
Strava is attempting to consider gender, age
Still very young stage

## Study Objective and Methods{auto-animate=true}
- To explore the number of contributed countries to OSM between gender and age 
- To quantify the diversity of OSM contributions between gender and age

- We first defined at individual level and then aggregated by averaging over users with same gender and age cohort
- Each individual will have a value between 0-1
    - 0: Less diverse (tends to be domestic)
    - 1: More diverse

- Long-tail distribution was seen in men and women in 20s
- Women in 30s and over had fewer than 100 contributed countries
- Likely due to fewer survey participants, but OSM, in general, might have a similar distribution

- SDI: Female: 0.5 Male: 0.67
- Male participants were likely contribute to more countries than their female counterparts.
- However, two peaks of diversity patterns of the female users mean that the spatial preference within the group contrasts significantly

## Conclusion
::: {.panel-tabset}

### Exploratory Analysis

- Women’s spatial coverage to OSM were remarkably lower than that of men
- However, such variabilities can be identified by the disaggregation of gender and age
- Men in 20s' to over 50s' groups and women in the 20s' group had polarised contributions where the averages were at 40-50 countries but have extreme users who contribute to over 150 countries. 
- 60% of the participants made changes to the UK, the US, and Germany.

### Simpson’s Diversity Index

- Men: 0.67 Women 0.50
- Men were more likely to be spatial diverse than their female counterparts. However, this once again varied significantly by the age groups.

### Things we noticed
- Unequal samples: Men (188 persons) vs Women (30 persons) ⇐ might represent the online population?
- The nature of crowdsourcing: a few extreme users can change the entire statistics “long-tail”
