## Volunteers are not always representative


<p style="font-size:45px; margin-top: 1em; color: blue">
  Under-represented crowd
</p>
- A silent minority who needs information about public facilities
- A community with local knowledge but weakness in internet technology
- Voluntary works are to some extent associated with the time spent on computers and social media (Jago et al., 2014; Clary et al., 2020)

## Under-representation and Spatial Bias
* **Crowdsourced Data: Patchy Distribution Across Space & Time**
   - A well-known feature of the data from citizen science projects is the patchy distribution of maps across space and time
   - This leaves global citizen science datasets with spatial and temporal gaps and redundancies

<p style="margin-top: .5em">
* **Participants' Propensity to Volunteer**
   - The majority tend to contribute to more familiar areas
   - The minority spend less time on volunteered works, tend to contribute to neighbourhood areas
</p>

::: {.notes}
* Current literature of citizen science looking at spatial and temporal biases:
Ecological Fallacy
* Do not breakdown the records by demographic groups even though certain cohorts have different distributions than their counterparts. These studies only imply gender or age biases as a whole.
* Focus either on demographic characteristics or spatial and temporal patterns - the two perspectives are usually not put into relation with each other
* Strava is attempting to consider gender, age
* Still at very young stage

## Study Objective

<p style="font-size:45px; margin-top: 1em;">
  Can we quantify the spatial diversity of OSM contributions by demographic characteristics?

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1.5em"}
- Probability that any two randomly selected species from the sample will be different
   - 0: Low diversity (tends to be domestic)
   - 1: High diversity
- **N**: Total Number of Individual Organisms
- **n**: Number of individuals at particular species

<!-- - We first defined at individual level and then aggregated by averaging over users with same gender and age cohort -->

- SID: Female: 0.50 Male: 0.67
- Male participants were likely contribute to more countries than their female counterparts.
- However, two peaks of diversity patterns of the female users mean that the spatial preference within the group contrasts significantly

## Conclusion
::: {.panel-tabset}

### Exploratory Analysis

- 60% of the participants made changes to the UK, the US, and Germany.
- OSM Spatial coverage: Women were remarkably lower than that of men
- However, such variabilities was identified by the disaggregation of gender and age
    * Men between 20s-50s & Women in 20s

::: {.notes}
- Men in 20s' to over 50s' groups and women in the 20s' group had polarised contributions where the averages were at 40-50 countries but have extreme users who contribute to over 150 countries. 
:::

### Simpson’s Index of Diversity

- Men were more likely to be spatial diverse than their female counterparts.
   * M: .67, W: .50
- However, this once again varied significantly by the age groups.

| Age  | Men  | Women |
|------|------|-------|
| 20s: | 0.7  | 0.42  |
| 30s: | 0.69 | 0.63  |
| 40s: | 0.66 | 0.51  |
| 50s: | 0.64 | 0.44  |


### Things we noticed
- Unequal samples: Men (188 persons) vs Women (30 persons) ⇐ might represent the online population?
- Loosely categorised of unstructured sampling: a few extreme users can change the entire statistics “long-tail”
- Ways to minimise the uneven spatial coverage:
   - the use of sophisticated methods
   - filtering
   - inter-observer skills
- More thoughts needed
   - "Gendered ageism": intersectionality of age and gender bias
